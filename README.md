## Overview

This repository contains all the files and resources related to our school project. We are working trying to avoid technical debt and create a high-quality solution, so we shall document our architectural decisions, conventions and basic developer docs here. This README file provides an overview of the repository and instructions for getting started.

## Contents

The repository contains the following directories:

- `docs`: This directory contains documentation related to the project, such as design documents, requirements specifications, and user manuals.
- `src`: This directory contains the source code for the project.
- `tests`: This directory contains test files for the project.
- `resources`: This directory contains resources such as images, icons, and other assets used in the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Adding an SSH Key to GitHub

In order to access the repository, you'll need to add your SSH key to your GitHub account. To do this, follow the steps below:

- Open Git Bash or Terminal on your local machine.
- Type `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"` and press Enter. Make sure you enter the same E-Mail that you use for GitHub.
- It will prompt you to enter a file in which to save the key. Press Enter to accept the default file location (just press enter bro).
- You will then be prompted to enter a passphrase. You can either enter a passphrase or leave it blank.
- Your SSH key will be generated and saved to your default file location, typically in the `.ssh` directory.
- Use the command `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` to display your public SSH key.
- Copy the output to your clipboard.
- Log in to your GitHub account and go to `Settings > SSH and GPG keys`. Click `New SSH key`. Paste your public SSH key into the `Key` field. Give your key a descriptive title and click `Add SSH key`.
